# GovCom Chatbot Knowledge Base Documentation

## Overview

The GovCom chatbot uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system with a comprehensive knowledge base extracted directly from the actual GovCom website content. This ensures accurate, up-to-date information about the company's services, capabilities, and offerings.

## How the Knowledge Base is Created

### 1. **Content Extraction Process**
The knowledge base is created by **scraping and extracting content** from the actual GovCom website pages:

- **`src/pages/AIServices.tsx`** → Service descriptions, features, complexity ratings
- **`src/pages/CaseStudies.tsx`** → Real case studies, project details, outcomes
- **`src/pages/Industries.tsx`** → Industry-specific information and services
- **`src/pages/Contact.tsx`** → Contact information, address, phone, email
- **`src/pages/Index.tsx`** → Company overview and general information

### 2. **Data Structure**
The knowledge base is structured as a JavaScript object with the following sections:

```javascript
const GOVCOM_KNOWLEDGE_BASE = {
  company: { /* Company overview, expertise, contact */ },
  services: { /* All service offerings with details */ },
  caseStudies: { /* Real project examples and outcomes */ },
  industries: { /* Industry-specific solutions */ },
  technologies: { /* Technologies and tools used */ },
  capabilities: { /* Company capabilities and expertise */ },
  contactInfo: { /* Complete contact information */ }
}
```

### 3. **Content Validation**
All content is manually verified against the website to ensure:
- ✅ **Accuracy** - Information matches the actual website
- ✅ **Completeness** - All major services and capabilities are covered
- ✅ **Consistency** - Descriptions align across different pages
- ✅ **Timeliness** - Information reflects current offerings

## How the Knowledge Base is Processed

### 1. **RAG Implementation**
The chatbot uses a **two-step process**:

1. **Retrieval**: `retrieveRelevantInfo(question)` function searches the knowledge base
2. **Generation**: AI model (Gemini) generates responses using retrieved context

### 2. **Question Processing**
The system analyzes user questions to identify:
- **Contact requests** → Returns phone, email, address
- **Service inquiries** → Returns relevant service descriptions
- **Case study questions** → Returns project examples
- **Industry questions** → Returns industry-specific solutions
- **Technology questions** → Returns technical capabilities

### 3. **Context Enhancement**
Before sending to AI, the system:
- Prepends relevant knowledge base information
- Creates enhanced prompts with company context
- Ensures AI responses are grounded in accurate information

## Knowledge Base Storage and Management

### 1. **Storage Location**
- **File**: `src/components/ChatbotWidget.tsx`
- **Variable**: `GOVCOM_KNOWLEDGE_BASE`
- **Type**: JavaScript constant object

### 2. **Update Process**
To update the knowledge base:

1. **Extract new content** from updated website pages
2. **Update the object** in `ChatbotWidget.tsx`
3. **Test responses** to ensure accuracy
4. **Commit and deploy** changes

### 3. **Version Control**
- Knowledge base changes are tracked in Git
