# üöÄ RAG Implementation for GovCom Chatbot

## Overview
The GovCom Solutions chatbot has been upgraded from a generic AI assistant to a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) powered chatbot** that has comprehensive knowledge about GovCom's capabilities, services, and past projects.

## What is RAG?
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique that combines:
1. **Retrieval**: Finding relevant information from a knowledge base

This ensures the chatbot provides accurate, company-specific information rather than generic responses.
