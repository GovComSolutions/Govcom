- HTML5 semantic structure: header, nav, main, section, footer.
- CSS for glassmorphism: backdrop-filter, border-radius, box-shadow, pastel/neon color palette.
- Responsive layout using CSS Flexbox/Grid and media queries.
- JavaScript for dynamic content: smooth scrolling, interactive cards, dynamic section loading.
- Optional: Use of lightweight libraries (e.g., Swiper.js for carousels, no heavy frameworks unless required).
- Accessibility: ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, color contrast.

# Development Roadmap

# Risks and Mitigations

  Mitigation: Use lightweight CSS/JS, optimize images, and test on multiple devices.

  Mitigation: Follow WCAG guidelines, test with screen readers, and ensure keyboard navigation.
- Risk: Scope creep with feature requests.  
  Mitigation: Stick to phased roadmap and prioritize MVP features.
